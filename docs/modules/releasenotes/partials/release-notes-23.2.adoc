== Scout JS

=== Form

[#modal-optional-for-views]
==== Modal Optional for Views

Until now, the default value for `modal` was true.
This has been changed so that the default now depends on the `displayStyle`:
It is still true for `Form.DisplayStyle.Dialog`, but false for `Form.DisplayStyle.View`.

This means if you require your view to be `modal`, set it to true. Otherwise, you can remove the setting.

The reason why this was changed is, because it is less common to have modal views, which also aligns it with the behavior of Scout Classic.

=== MenuTypes

==== Default menuTypes

Default menuTypes have been added to several widgets.
This means that e.g. the `Table` treats a menu without a menuType as if it had set `Table.MenuTypes.EmptySpace`.
For more information about the default menuTypes see xref:technical-guide:user-interface/widget-reference.adoc#menu-types[MenuTypes].

== Changes in Scout Classic

=== Health Check Servlet

The logic of executing health checks was extracted from `org.eclipse.scout.rt.server.commons.healthcheck.AbstractHealthCheckServlet` and moved to an own `org.eclipse.scout.rt.server.commons.healthcheck.HealthCheckService`.

The `AbstractHealthCheckServlet` is no longer abstract, was renamed to `HealthCheckServlet` and may be used without further individualization.

To update to the new servlet, the following changes in your `web.xml` are necessary:

* UI Server: Replace `org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html.admin.healthcheck.UiHealthCheckServlet` with `org.eclipse.scout.rt.server.commons.healthcheck.HealthCheckServlet` in your `web.xml`
* Backend Server: Replace `org.eclipse.scout.rt.server.admin.healthcheck.ServerHealthCheckServlet` with `org.eclipse.scout.rt.server.commons.healthcheck.HealthCheckServlet` in your `web.xml`
